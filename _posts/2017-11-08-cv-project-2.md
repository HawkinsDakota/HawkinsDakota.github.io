## Automating Centroid Detection of Primary Mesenchyme Cells in Confocal Images
  
Metastatic events in tumor cells account for roughly 90% of cancer-related deaths. However, metastasis is still poorly understood. To shine light on foundational events present during metastatic transitions, my lab studies the movement and pattern formation of primary mesenchyme cells in developing sea urchins. Cell migration and pattern formation are largely signal-dependent events, where signals from surrounding cells induce patterning and/or motility. Thus, positional information that determines *where* cells exist and *where* signals originate from are integral in understanding many cellular events. However, determining centers for individual cells is time consuming, and becomes impractical with prolific cell types.  The goal of this project is to utilize computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically detect flourescently tagged cells and return their 3-dimensional centroids in cofocal images. Specifically, I will be using images of stained primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) in developing sea urchins. Images will be provided by Cynthia Bradham's lab at Boston University. This is an individual project.

### Input Images
Confocal images are partial volume images where cross sectional images are taken at different depths. Slices are then projected to create a three-dimensional image, as seen below.

For this project, each embryo has 27 image slices that comprise all cross sections.
